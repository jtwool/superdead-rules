## Civil Organizations

Civil organizations reflect both the best and worst aspects of society. On one hand, they represent self-less public servants who give their lives and careers for the betterment of their neighbors and fellow citizens. On the other, they are home to the most corrupt grifters who line their pockets on the backs of the misfortunate, and the self-righteous zealots who believe they alone can know the good path for everyone.

### Government
Where an arm of government has made it to the end of days, it is no doubt due to the charisma of a cunning politician. Savvy and charming, a good politician can encourage their supporters just as well in the end of days as in the before times. Arguably, the skill is even more powerful now: keeping their hands clean while others risk their lives on their behalf.

Followers who are attracted to government organizations are optimists, who believe that their is a return to normal possible. And they look down on those who would turn to crime to stay alive.

## Criminal Organizations
The ruthless and secretive nature of criminal organizations prepared them better, in many ways, for the end of the world. 

Now, with governments weakened or destroyed altogether, these criminal organizations--which always had their own codes of conduct and systems of order--can self actualize as twisted, ruthless versions of society.

But being at the mercy of one may still be better than being dead.

### Motorcycle Gangs
Motorcycle gangs, outlaw motorcycle clubs, or 1%ers are bad mama jamas who break laws and ride bikes.

While the motorcycle has always been a symbol of recklessness, it is even more so in the end of times. Only the craziest survivors will get on the back of a loud machine certain to attract zombies.

That said, motorcycle gang members are as savage and savvy as they are reckless. Before the apocalypse these gangs trafficked in arms, drugs, and people. All of that has continued since the end of the world.

Where these gangs operate, they are a fearsome threat. Not only because of their propensity towards violence and chaos, but because of the zombies that are inevitable following them wherever their bikes roar.

### International Crime Syndicates
International crime syndicates were highly organized criminal enterprises that operated across national borders. Their operations were numerous and nefarious, including: drug trafficking, arms smuggling, human trafficking, and money laundering. 

These organizations, such as the Mafia, Yakuza, Triads, and various cartels, are known for their hierarchical structures, extensive networks, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

| Name | Home Country |
| :- | :- | 
| Cartel | Mexico
| Irish Mob | Ireland
| Mafia | Italy
| Russian Mob | Russia
| Triads | China
| Yakuza | Japan

In normal times, they thrive by exploiting weaknesses in law enforcement and government oversight, leveraging corruption, violence, and secrecy to maintain their power and influence.

In a zombie apocalypse, branches of international crime syndicates were quickly able to leverage their existing resources and cunning ruthlessness to survive and sometimes even thrive amid the chaos. 

With governments and law enforcement agencies weakened or collapsed, these organizations have no one to stop them from using their power to further their evil, but profitable operations.

### Street Gangs

Street Gangs emerged out of the need for the forgotten people to protect their own. And in the zombie apocalypse, they continued doing just that.

These gangs often have flatter and more dynamic structures than other gangs. And while they may use names that are shared with other gangs, their relationships and alliances are localized.

Street gangs first and foremost objective is to control heir territory and provide a quality life for their full members. And they will do anything to achieve that.

### Prison Gangs

Prison gangs are so named because they exist primarily inside of prisons, and exert pressure inside-out: from the prison onto the streets.

The prison gangs that exist in the post-apocalypse world are needing to adapt to the new reality of life outside the prison walls. But because of the prisons natural security, the few surviving prison gangs have large portions of their membership intact.

That makes these gangs formidable forces on the scene where ever they exist, with many members given a second chance at life by the zombie apocalypse that they never would have had otherwise.
