## Civil Organizations

Civil organizations reflect both the best and worst aspects of society. On one hand, they represent self-less public servants who give their lives and careers for the betterment of their neighbors and fellow citizens. On the other, they are home to the most corrupt grifters who line their pockets on the backs of the misfortunate, and the self-righteous zealots who believe they alone can know the good path for everyone.

### Government
Where an arm of government has made it to the end of days, it is no doubt due to the charisma of a cunning politician. Savvy and charming, a good politician can encourage their supporters just as well in the end of days as in the before times. Arguably, the skill is even more powerful now: keeping their hands clean while others risk their lives on their behalf.

Followers who are attracted to government organizations are optimists, who believe that their is a return to normal possible. And they look down on those who would turn to crime to stay alive.

### Firefighters
Firefighters——both career and volunteer——are fearless and physically impressive. Used to braving danger for their fellow man at a moments notice, the apocalypse is in some way, not so new. The threat, however, is much deadlier than what they are used to.

Firefighters thrive on comradery, self-sacrifice, duty, and action. Where organizations of firefighters have survived into the end times, they always seek to rescue other survivors and organize for safety. With a strong preference for action, firefighters stake out into the world to save lives——often tearing up buildings in the process.

### Police
At their best, police organizations are hierarchical, with a strict chain of command, and operate according to the code of law. Because they are well ordered and disciplined, many police organizations did survive into the end of days. There, they largely operate in the same fashion they always have: enforcing rules and protecting the populace, from both zombie, human, and mutant threats.

At their worst, police organizations are rigid, inflexible, and intentionally ignore the suffering of the people they purport to protect——to say nothing of nakedly corrupt. In the end of times, these flaws can be exaggerated. A jaded police organization can grow to see everyone as a lawbreaker, a threat, or simply someone that can be taken advantage of without recourse.

##### Police Organization Objectives 
| 1d10 | Police Objective | 
| :-: | :- | 
| 1-2 | Reclaim territory
| 3-4 | Punish lawbreakers
| 5-8 | Protect survivors 
| 9 | Kill mutants
| 10 | Any two

Because of their role in licensing  mutants and protecting the civilian population from mutants during the before times, some police officers have strongly held, negative prejudices towards mutants. Some police organizations even make it their primary goal to eliminate mutants, as they work to restore peace.

## Civilian Organizations

### Corporations 

### Religious Organizations
Religious organizations exist to cultivate community and nurture the faith of their followers——and never have community and faith been more essential than in the end of times. While their is nothing that makes these organizations particularly well suited for surviving a zombie apocalypse, religious organizations tend to be close knit and optimistic, as much as one can be at the end of the world.

### Labor Unions
Labor unions existed in a state of constant struggle before the end of times——but now their foe is even more soulless than ever. Labor unions are run by——and privilege the interests of——workers and members among others. Labor organizations have no fear about operating two tiered systems, where everyone pulls together, but only true members reap the full rewards.

Labor union organizations can also be home to leftist idealists who view the end of times as a blessing in disguise: an opportunity to rebuild societies free of capitalist exploitation and corporate greed.

### Research Labs

### Schools / Universities

### Secret Societies 
Remnants of days long past, when skilled tradesmen would meet in shadowy rooms to share secrets and shape the world's events in their favor, only a scarce few Secret Societies existed, and even fewer survived into the end of days. Those that did though, did so because they were prepared. They were a powerful force, lurking in the shadows all along, anticipating an apocalypse——if not several.

Now that its here, these Secret Societies have a plan to rebuild the world in their vision. Those who help them will reap their generosity; those who stand it their way, garner their wrath.

## Criminal Organizations
The ruthless and secretive nature of criminal organizations prepared them better, in many ways, for the end of the world. 

Now, with governments weakened or destroyed altogether, these criminal organizations--which always had their own codes of conduct and systems of order--can self actualize as twisted, ruthless versions of society.

But being at the mercy of one may still be better than being dead.

### Motorcycle Gangs
Motorcycle gangs, outlaw motorcycle clubs, or 1%ers are bad mama jamas who break laws and ride bikes.

While the motorcycle has always been a symbol of recklessness, it is even more so in the end of times. Only the craziest survivors will get on the back of a loud machine certain to attract zombies.

That said, motorcycle gang members are as savage and savvy as they are reckless. Before the apocalypse these gangs trafficked in arms, drugs, and people. All of that has continued since the end of the world.

Where these gangs operate, they are a fearsome threat. Not only because of their propensity towards violence and chaos, but because of the zombies that are inevitable following them wherever their bikes roar.

### International Crime Syndicates
International crime syndicates were highly organized criminal enterprises that operated across national borders. Their operations were numerous and nefarious, including: drug trafficking, arms smuggling, human trafficking, and money laundering. 

These organizations, such as the Mafia, Yakuza, Triads, and various cartels, are known for their hierarchical structures, extensive networks, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances. 

##### Select International Crime Syndicates with Generic Name and Base of Operations
| Name | Home Country |
| :- | :- | 
| Cartel | Mexico
| Irish Mob | Ireland
| Mafia | Italy
| Russian Mob | Russia
| Triads | China
| Yakuza | Japan

In normal times, they thrive by exploiting weaknesses in law enforcement and government oversight, leveraging corruption, violence, and secrecy to maintain their power and influence.

In a zombie apocalypse, branches of international crime syndicates were quickly able to leverage their existing resources and cunning ruthlessness to survive and sometimes even thrive amid the chaos. 

With governments and law enforcement agencies weakened or collapsed, these organizations have no one to stop them from using their power to further their evil, but profitable operations.

### Street Gangs

Street Gangs emerged out of the need for the forgotten people to protect their own. And in the zombie apocalypse, they continued doing just that.

These gangs often have flatter and more dynamic structures than other gangs. And while they may use names that are shared with other gangs, their relationships and alliances are localized.

Street gangs first and foremost objective is to control heir territory and provide a quality life for their full members. And they will do anything to achieve that.

### Prison Gangs

Prison gangs are so named because they exist primarily inside of prisons, and exert pressure inside-out: from the prison onto the streets.

The prison gangs that exist in the post-apocalypse world are needing to adapt to the new reality of life outside the prison walls. But because of the prisons natural security, the few surviving prison gangs have large portions of their membership intact.

That makes these gangs formidable forces on the scene where ever they exist, with many members given a second chance at life by the zombie apocalypse that they never would have had otherwise.


## Military Organizations

Prepared to defend the homeland, military organizations are some of the best suited to surviving a zombie apocalypse. They are stocked with well trained and disciplined warriors, who have committed to putting the mission first and their own survival second.

Military organizations can be bastions of peace and security. But they can be ruthless if you find yourself on the wrong side of their objectives.

### Army
Responsible for invasion and defense by land, the Army is in many ways the best equipped to directly deal with a local zombie threat. They have the most troops, ammunition, and tools to manage direct conflict with infantry-on-infantry combat——like the living dead.

Organizations built on the remnants of an Army command will distinguish themselves from other military organizations with zombie impenetrable vehicles——tanks and armored personnel carriers——as well as earth-moving vehicles and tactics for reinforcing positions for defense. Whether the Army can use these techniques effectively is another story.

Army organizations are in excellent position to defend against the zombie apocalypse, but their tactics rely heavily on both **fuel and ammo**. Without these resources, the army's approaches are dramatically less effective. Securing these supplies will become an essential activity.

### Navy
Unlike the land-locked army, many naval commands have survived simply by virtue of being isolated on or underneath the water. The nuclear reactors on board submarines and aircraft carriers are capable of powering these vessels for decades without interruption. And these carrier groups are wholly equipped armies, with Marines that can be dispatched for land operations; pilots who can provide surveillance, air cover, and deliver crushing anti-zombie ordinance; and any number of daring sailors, familiar with spartan conditions.

As such, navy organizations take the security of their boats as a first order priority, sending small teams onto land to incrementally secure territory. The limiting factor to their effectiveness——like common survivors, in many ways——is the availability of food, water, and other supplies necessary for daily life.

### Air Force



### Intelligence Agency
Intelligence Agencies are shadowy organizations adjacent to the military, used to operating in a clandestine fashion. They do not have the large armaments for direct conflict, but they have highly trained operatives and penchant for thinking outside the box.

Their true strengths lie in the ability to form relationships with diverse sets of power brokers, establish a strong situational awareness, and devise cunning plans to achieve their desired outcomes.

Any organization founded on the remnants of an intelligence agency is going to be hard to detect—likely operating under some form of cover—and with a dispersed network of moles and agents throughout the relevant location.
