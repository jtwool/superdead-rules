# Character Creation

The following steps can be used to quickly create Super Dead characters.

Super Dead characters can be recorded on a note card, a piece of paper, or [dedicated character sheet.](./character-sheet.pdf)

#### 1. Roll Attributes
Roll 4d6. Add 2 to each die and assign each value to an attribute. Higher is better.

#### 2. Powers
Select either:
- 2 powers at +2
- 1 power at +3, 1 power at +1
