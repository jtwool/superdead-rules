# Combat
You likely never thought you'd find yourself in a life or death fight. Unfortunately, that has become all too common. 

Whether you are fighting humans, mutants, or zombies, combat is now a fact of life.

> **Designer's Note:** Combat in Super Dead is not modeled on standard tabletop roleplaying game systems that allows for heroes to make decisions on a second-by-second basis. Rather, Super Dead combat is inspired by modern tactical war games. We've chosen to do this because modern firearms and Super Powers, which are present in Super Dead, feel silly in the extended duel-like encounters of fantasy TTRPGs. Firearms and Super Powers are too deadly, from too far away -- and encourage a style of combat where engaging rarely, and on your own terms, is the best approach.

## Phases of Combat
Combat in Super Dead takes place in rounds of three phases: [the movement phase](#the-movement-phase), [the hand-to-hand phase](#the-hand-to-hand-phase), and [the shooting phase](#the-shooting-phase).

### The Movement Phase 
During the movement phase, you declare your intent to move. You may move 30 feet with **standard movement** or up to 100 feet with **reckless movement**.

Reckless movement makes any other task **very hard** and makes attacks against you **easy**.

If you move into another character's line of sight, you are exposed to **opportunity fire**. If you take opportunity fire, regardless of whether or not you take damage, you must make a **courage save**. On a failed save, you must retreat and find cover.

__Opportunity fire__ is a free ranged attack against a combatant who enters your line of sight. You may take one opportunity attack per target so long as you have ammunition (if necessary).

### The Hand-to-Hand Phase 
After the [movement phase](#the-movement-phase) is resolved, if there are any combatants within [**immediate range**](#ranges) of one another, the hand-to-hand phase of combat occurs.

The hand-to-hand phase consists of up to **three exchanges** of attacks. Within an exchange, each combatant declares their intention, and then attacks are resolved simultaneously. 

Shooting a pistol or shotgun at immediate range is **hard**, and shooting a long-gun is **very hard**. Attacks with ranged powers are also **hard**.

| Situation | Difficulty in H2H | Modifier | 
| :- | :- | :-: |
| Handheld Weapon | Normal | - |
| Pistol | Hard |  +1 
| Shotgun | Hard | +1 
| Other gun | Very Hard | +2 
| Melee Power | Normal | -
| Ranged Power | Hard | +1 

After damage has been dealt, for each exchange, another exchange occurs until one side has been entirely eliminated or until three hand-to-hand exchanges have occurred.

Fighting in hand-to-hand combat when outnumbered is at least **hard**, but can be **very hard**, or **extremely hard** depending on the number and skill of your opponents.

#### Fighting
To hit in hand-to-hand combat with a handheld weapon--such as a bat, knife, axe, or even your fists--you must make a fighting check. On a successful fighting check, you deal damage to your opponent determined by the weapon you are using.

Because most characters will not be skilled in fighting, the default is a **hard** **athletics** save.


### The Shooting Phase 
Once the movement and hand-to-hand phases have been resolved, combatants in the ranges close, near, and far may declare one target within range of their weapon and make a ranged attack. 

All successful ranged attackers roll damage, and damage is evaluated simultaneously for all combatants.

The best way to avoid enemy fire is by hiding behind **cover**. Cover may make you **hard**, **very hard**, or **extremely hard** to hit, depending on the quality and degree of cover. If you are completely shielded by cover, you may not be targeted.

#### Shooting
To hit a target with a firearm, you must make a successful shooting check. On a successful shooting check, you deal damage to your opponent determined by the weapon you are using.

Because most characters will not be skilled in shooting, the default is a **hard** **athletics** save.

## Ranges
There are four ranges of engagement. From farthest to nearest, they are: 

1. Far range
2. Near range
3. Close range, and
4. Immediate range.
 
**Far range** begins at 1,000 feet and requires the use of specialized weapons. 

**Near range**, from 300 feet up to 1,000 feet, is the ideal range to engage with a rifle, but too far for many powers. 

**Close range**, from 30 to 300 feet is the most typical engagement distance, and is the effective range of both handguns and ranged powers. 

**Immediate range**, within 30 feet, is the range for hand-to-hand combat.

Shooting beyond the range of your weapon is **very hard** or **extremely hard**.

Zombies must get to immediate range to attack.

## Attacks, Damage, and Wounds

When you take damage, you may subtract any armor you have from the damage taken. For every five points of damage remaining, you incur one wound.

If you have taken no wounds, you are **healthy**. If you have taken one or two wounds you are **hurt**. If you have taken three wounds you are **wounded**. At four wounds, you are severly wounded. Upon five wounds, you suffer from **disfigurement** or **death**.

| Wounds | Status | Recovery | Penalty |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | Healthy | - | - |
| 1-2 | Hurt | End of Combat | Hard |
| 3 | Wounded | First Aid / Medicine | Very Hard |
| 4 | Severely Wounded | First Aid / Medicine | Very Hard |
| 5 | Disfigured or Dead | Never |  Very Hard |

Being hurt makes things **hard**. Being wounded makes things **very hard**.

You naturally go from **hurt** back to **healthy** as soon as combat ends. 

### Being Wounded

If you are wounded, you will need medical attention to recover. A successful **first aid** save will treat the wound, but leave you with its lingering effects for 28 hours. A failed **first aid** save will leave you with the lingering effects of the wound for 7 days.

For a severe wound, you will suffering lingering effects of the wound for 7 days on a successful **first aid** check, and 28 days on a failed check.

A successful **medicine** save will relieve you of all effects of the wound.

| 2d6 | Wound  
| :-: | :- | 
| 2 | Severe Burn |
| 3 | Dislocation |
| 4 | Laceration | 
| 5 |  Minor Burn | 
| 6 | Bruising | 
| 7 | Sprained Ligaments | 
| 8 | Broken Bone| 
| 9 | Minor Concussion | 
| 10 | Compound Fracture |
| 11 | Severe Concussion |
| 12 | Tissue Loss |

#### Disfigurement and Death

Upon taking your fifth wound, you will either become disfigured or die. 

You may elect to become disfigured up to three times. Each time you do so, you and your game master will come up with a permanent injury your character will suffer, and the penalty for that injury.

If you already have three disfigurements, or you elect not to select a disfigurement, you die.

| 1d8 | Disfigurement | 1d8 | Disfigurement
| :-: | :- | :-: | :- 
| 1 | Death | 5 | Severed Hand
| 2 | Facial Scar | 6| Lost Eye
| 3 | Lost Ear |7 | Mangled Jaw
| 4 | Limp Leg | 8| Annihilated Arm

## Using Powers in Combat

You will often want to use super powers in combat. When you do so, make a power roll to determine the strength of the expression of your powers. 

As long as you achieve at least one success, in your power dice pool, you will deal damage. If you do, make a damage roll based on the corresponding intensity.

If all your dice are below the target number you deal no damage.

If you are **cracked**, subtract any dice below your stress level from the number of successes before counting your successes.

> _**Example**: Fionna Firefist is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with two bad guys. She rolls her Bravo 2 power "fire control" and gets a 3 and an 6. The 6 is above her target number (4), so she succeeds in her attack and can deal damage. She can either choose to deal 9 damage to one opponent, or 3 damage to one and 6 to the other._
