# Powers

## Powers 
Your character's powers are rated by the bonus they apply to your power rolls. You will either start with 2 powers rated at +2 or a single power rated at +3. 

### List of Powers

## Using Powers 
To use a power, you will compare the result of a power roll to the power scale table to determine if you mustered enough energy to create your desired effect.

To make a power roll, roll 3d10, count the number of dice that exceed the target number, and add your power's rank. The standard target number is 6.

> **Example.** Bianca Blues wants to use a Sonic Blast (+3) to open a whole in a brick wall. She rolls 3d10 and gets a 3, a 6, and a 8. The 6 and 8 are at or above the target number, so her power roll total is a 5: 2 successes plus her +3 rating for Sonic Blast. She compares this to power scale table and finds that 5 successes is enough to destroy brick: brick wall demolished.

## Power Surge
Your powers are not fixed: they ebb and flow with your energy, adrenaline and intensity. At critical times, you can surge your powers to achieve incredible effects that you are normally incapable of. Doing so is stressful, but allows you to temporarily exceed your normal limitations.

When you perform a power surge, you add a number of dice to your power roll die pool and incur a number of stress. To add 1 die to your die pool, you will incur 1 point of stress. To add 2 dice to your die pool, you will incur 3 points of stress. 

During your power surge, any 10s rolled during your power rolls "explode": you can reroll them and add subsequent successes to your success count. Any 10s rolled during these subsequent rolls explode as well.

> **Designer's Note:** Because this is a rules-light system that involving super powers, you will often find yourself wondering "would a player's powers be able to do that?" If the answer seems to rest somewhere between certainly yes and certainly not, allow the player to take a power surge to accomplish the feat.

## Power Soak
Your powers also provide you with an enhanced durability. You can use your powers to soak damage. Whenever you would take a wound, instead, you may choose to soak that damage with one of your powers.

When you soak damage, you temporarily reduce a power by as many levels as you would have taken wounds. Your power stays at this reduced level for 24 hours, or until you have a full night's sleep, whichever is longer.

Powers reduced below +1 in this way cannot be used until you have recovered.

If you incur more wounds than you can soak with a single power, you can use multiple powers to soak the damage. If damage is partially soaked, the remainder is incurred as wounds.

## Using Powers While Cracked
When you have cracked, controlling your powers becomes more difficult.

Whenever you make a power roll, subtract any dice below your stress level from the number of successes you would have achieved.

If the number of dice rolled below your stress level is greater than the number of successes rolled, you have lost control of your powers.

Roll on the table below:

| 1d10 | Outcome |
| :-: | :- |
| 1 | All powers go to +0 until you recover a point of stress
| 2-3 | Power used goes to +0 until you recover a point of stress | 
| 4-6 | Power drops 1 rank (-1)
| 7-8 | Reroll with power surge (4d10, take 1 stress), random target
| 9 | Reroll with power surge (5d10, take 2 stress), random target
| 10 | Power surge (5d10, 0 stress), random target
