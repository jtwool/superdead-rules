# Super Showdowns

When supers collide, the gritty tactical firefights that define human-to-human and human-to-zombie combat disappear, giving way to extended, dramatic showdowns where mutants toss their powers back and forth.

Super Showdowns proceed in an orderless series of turns. When the showdown begins, the gamemaster will determine who acts first.

When it is your turn to act, you can either declare a **super showdown action** using your powers, or you can **attempt to flee**.

### Super Showdown Actions
When taking an action during a super showdown, you will (1) declare what you are attempting to do, (2) name the characters that you are interacting with, and (3) roll the dice associated with the power you used to accomplish the action.

If any of your dice are 4 or higher, your action is successful. The gamemaster will narrate the results, add 1d6 to the **Showdown Stakes die pool**, and you will pick one of the players you interacted with to go next. This can be either an ally or a foe.

If all your dice are below 4, your action is unsuccessful. You will roll all the dice in the **Showdown Stakes dice pool**. For each die below a 4, you will take 1 wound. As normal, you can **power soak** to avoid taking wounds. The gamemaster will then narrate the result of your failed attempt and determine the next to act.

### Flee
If the tides have turned against you, and it is your turn to act, you can choose to cut and run. To escape the showdown, declare your attempt and roll the associated power pool. If any die shows a 3 or better, you escape and the gamemaster will narrate the results.

If you fail your flee attempt, you incur a wound. The gamemaster will narrate the results and determine who acts next.

## Noise
Clashes between super-powered beings are loud. After the sixth die is added to the **showdown stakes dice pool** and for every two dice thereafter (i.e., 8, 10, 12...), the gamemaster will secretly check determine how many zombies the showdown has attracted, and how long they will take to arrive.

Each wave of zombies attracted in this way contains at least 2d8 zombies and arrives in 1d10 minutes.

When the zombies arrive, they follow the Zomb-3 and enter combat. The showdown is then over and standard combat rules apply.
