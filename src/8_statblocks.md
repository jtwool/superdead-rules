### Police Officer
Police officers are the backbone of a civilized society. These officers patrol the streets and keep them safe. They are often armed with civilian hand guns, and have received basic training in small arms and conflict de-escalation. 

*Gear: Handgun (2d10-2), handcuffs, radio, first aid kit, flashlight, extendable baton (2d4)* 

###  Police Sniper
Police Snipers have been specially trained to handle sniper rifles and support highly volatile hostage and counter-sniper situations. 

*Gear: Sniper rifle (4d10), handgun (2d10-2), radio, first aid kit*

### Detective
These plain-clothes officers work the streets, attempting to build relationships and gather information about potential crimes. They pride themselves on being a bit more grounded, effective, and independent than normal officers.

*Gear: Handgun (2d10-2), handcuffs, badge.*

### S.W.A.T.
S.W.A.T. officers are the best conditioned and best trained officers a police force has. Like other police officers, they are trained in defensive and protective tactics, and conflict de-escalation.

*Gear: Rifle (3d10), handgun (2d10-2), riot shield, extendable baton (1d10-3)*

### Solider
Infantry are the backbone of the military. Whether Army or Marines, these soldiers are professionals ready for battle -- and most other challenges.

*Gear: Rifle (3d10), 7 magazines, first-aid kit, rations, helmet, body armor*
 
Alternate loadouts:

- *Machine Gun (4d10), 2 magazines, first-aid kit, rations, helmet, body armor*
- *Sniper Rifle (4d10), 5 magazines, first-aid kit, rations, helmet, body armor*
- *Rifle (3d10), 7 magazines, medics kit, rations, helmet, body armor*

### Special Ops
Special forces are the most elite fighting units on the planet. These highly trained operators are accustomed to extreme stress and deprivation and have been highly trained in battle tactics. 

*Gear: Rifle (3d10), 7 magazines, handgun (2d10-2) first-aid kit, rations, helmet, body armor*

### Survivor
An everyday person, just trying to get through the end of days...

*Gear: 2 days rations, makeshift weapon (1d10-5)*

### Scientist
A researcher, doctor, or other scientific professional. Much of what they knew about the world, the cold and dispassionate world of books, has to be thrown out of the window now...

*Gear: Pen and notepad, book*

### Preacher
Persuasive religious figures are able to get many through times of crisis. And there has never been a time where more sought faith than the zombie apocalypse.

*Gear: Unarmed. Holy symbol or book.*

### Zealot
These true believers have chosen to believe in something, instead of succumbing to nihilist temptations of an empty world. Believing makes them strong, if a bit crazy.

*Gear: Handgun (2d10-2), holy symbol*

### Street Criminal
Whether they were privy to a life of crime before the end of days, or have just embraced a world without law, these criminals pay no mind to the old standards. All that matters now is what you can get away with.

*Gear: Handgun (2d10-2), knife (1d10), drugs, dice*

### Crime Lord
All those who live the life of crime are trying to get rich; those who have are crime lords. These powerful figures call the shots, and rarely have to get their hands dirty to get their way.

*Gear: Handgun (2d10-2)*
