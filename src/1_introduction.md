# Introduction

**Super Dead** is a superhero-horror roleplaying game that takes place in a zombie-apocalypse world caused by the U.S. Navy's botched attempt to prevent World War 3. In this game, you will take the role of a mutant-powered survivor and attempt to make what you can out of the end of the world.

You will gather supplies, rescue survivors, and face off against villains, while staying one step ahead of the ever present zombie threat.

Super Dead is designed to be rules-light and intuitive, encouraging quick, narrative-driven decision making, inspired by the [New School Revolution](https://newschoolrevolution.com/what-is-the-new-school-revolution-part-1/) in tabletop gaming as well as modern tactical war games.

Everything you need to play can be found in this ruleset.

**Combat**

8. Combat takes place in rounds of three phases: movement, hand-to-hand, and shooting.
2. During **[the movement phase](4_combat.md#the-movement-phase)**, you can move 30 feet normally, or 100 feet recklessly.
