# Micro Settings
The following micro settings are designed to get you into the game quickly.

## Gulf Pearl, Texas
Gulf Pearl is a massive, sprawling graveyard of a city. It’s giant highways served as deathtraps for those who sought to escape, and the mobs of zombies that roam the streets at night prove it: everything is bigger in Texas.

The shining beacon of Gulf Pearl is and has always been the headquarters of the American Oil Corporation. Their business has long since diversified from oil, but now it rests almost entirely on surviving the end of days. 

Other surviving factions include the remnants of an international drug cartel and government rocket scientists at NASA.

## San Buho, California
They say a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. That’s exactly what some survivors of San Buho think that the Navy is doing back in town.

With an operational aircraft carrier, and a third of the naval base liberated from the undead, the Navy’s outpost in San Buho may be the most secure place to lay one’s head in the world after.

But some factions aren’t quick to forgive: like the Blind Devil biker gang, or local parishioners and survivors of Our Lady of Guadalupe’s mutant priest: Father Juan Ayala.

## Skunk City, Iowa
Skunk City’s survivors are the motly, scrappy residents of a Midwestern College town. While farmers and academics, pastors and doctors wouldn’t normally have much in common, they’re finding ways to get along.

But as it has always been with Skunk City, new people keep showing up and they don’t always care about the survivors of Skunk City.

Skunk City’s factions include a coalition of independent farmers, holding onto their land, and a mutant doctor who will do anything to find a cure.

## Fellsmore, Maryland
The streets of Fell, Maryland are as dangerous as ever.  The surviving residents take to heart that the gang violence their city could never tamper would not be stopped by a zombie apocalpyse either.

While eastside and westside gangsters fight between and amongst themselves, the Dockworkers Union have carved out a patch of life down by the docks, and a group of survivors are holed up in the reknowned Sammuel Johns hospital searching for a cure.

And on the streets, a rumor is going around that a member of the Fell’s Street Five superhero team may have survived after all.

## West Moriches, New York
60 miles from the ruins of New York City, a small sanctuary has emerged in the city of West Moriches. 

Protected by Gregory "Geo Dude" Godwin and the rock walls he has erected around the city, West Moriches offers a haven from which survivors can venture out into the zombie wasteland, in search of survivors or a cure.

> **Designer's Note:** Though this setting can be used for any type of campaign, it is particularly intended for a "West Marches" style campaign that gets more challenging as the players farther and farther west towards New York City.
