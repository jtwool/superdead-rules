## Introduction
This section is intended for game masters and those who would like advice on how to run a game or campaign of Super Dead.

Running supers-meets-zombies comic horror is different in a number of notable ways from both classic dungeon-crawling medieval fantasy, gothic-punk supernatural storytelling, and  post-apocalyptic narrative gaming. The more you lean into what makes Super Dead unique, the more fun and rewarding you and your players will find the game.

### Tone and expectations
The tone of a Super Dead game is more ominous than in traditional tabletop games. The player characters will be super-powered, but the omnipresence of zombies, any of which can kill them in a single bite, is nevertheless scary. Combined with the noise mechanics, players will be on their best behavior, even when there are no zombies to be found. Zombies are mindless, autonomic killers. Play them straight and play them deadly.

On the flip side, your players' characters will have super powers. And with this comes two challenges: one of tone and one of power expression. With respect to tone, there is a natural conflict between the lightness created by the characters super powers and the darkness of the zombie apocalypse. Learn to love this contrast! The characters will breeze by any number of challenges because the world is not designed to keep them out. The world was designed for mortals. This is good. 

At the same time, ground these powers in reality. Every time a character uses their super strength to rip off a door or break down a wall, they risk attracting zombies. Every time a character lights a room on fire with their flame control, they risk burning vital resources.

You should encourage your players to use their powers to interact with the environment and explore their powers in creative ways. The attitude of players should be towards doing more with their powers, while appreciating their limits. Those limits are defined in the power scale table. Having super strength is great. But using that super strength in the context of the world is constrained.

The player characters start as weak street-level heroes and ascend to powerful street-level heroes, but at every stage, they are highly vulnerable. The power scale chart starts at powerless and street-level characters that would fit in on the dark streets of the world's most popular bat-themed hero, and ascends to the universe-level powers of a certain super-strong, super-fast, laser-eye having, flying alien journalist.

That all said, your players will ask you to do things with their powers that are outside of what they can reasonably achieve. If the chart clearly makes the task impossible (for example, lifting a 5 ton object when your super strength roll only lets you lift 1200lbs) you can simply narrate failure. If the resolution is ambiguous – for example, with respect to the application and breadth of a power – you should call for power surges or power stunts. This takes the conversation away from "can I do this?" permission-asking, to "I want to do this, what is it going to cost?". A 1 or 2 point power surge or stunt is common manuever to enable these extraordinary feats. Players will quickly understand the costs associated with these tasks and they will become part of the players reasoning about the limitations of their character.

### Modern Zombie Game with Supers
Playing a tabletop roleplaying game is about immersing yourself in a character and a world, and watching as stories emerge in that world. What grounds the game is how well the mechanics simulate being in the scenarios the characters are in. This requires a common understanding of setting. A supers-meets-zombies game is easier in many ways to model, because it is relatively close to reality. The apocalypse is a near-modern setting, so we all have some familiarity with it. The physics are mostly the same.

When it comes to physics, we all pretty much understand how the supers-meets-zombies world works: it works like ours works. However, when it comes to the narratives, we can have distinct ideas of what is meaningful in a supers-meets-zombies world. Here are some tropes you should strongly consider when running a supers-meets-zombies game.

#### The humans were the bad guys all along
One of the worst parts about a zombie apocalypse is seeing what becomes of your fellow man. How much do we give in to our animal instincts and authoritarian tendencies as stress rises and stakes become dire? Who has morality and who knows only the will to survive?

Double crossing, back-stabbing, and two-faced underhanded behavior are common at the end of the world. Many people are just looking out for themselves. This is especially painful when it comes from NPCs your players have come to like, trust, or even love.

Some humans are courageous. Others are vile. Include both in your game.

#### Rogues gallery
Heroes are nothing without their foils. The Bat is defined by the Clown; the Spider is defined by the Goblin. When coming up with villains, think about the flaws, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities of your players characters, and choose aspects that play into those traits. If one of the players is playing a high-school science nerd who carries around the guilt of his uncle's death, make the main villain a wealthy, genius scientist who is generous with his time and affirmations, but has a wicked alter ego set on murdering his rivals.

A common trope of members of the Rogue's Gallery is that they come back. However, this often means they won't be fighting to the death. To frame this, it is important that heroes and villains don't hate one another, so much as they oppose one another. And in the zombie apocalypse, they do have one thing in common: a desire to stay alive in the face of the zombie hordes. Use this! 

Your heroes do not always need to fight against your rogues. Have your heroes fight alongside the villains against zombies. Or against other villains. Or against human factions.

#### Retribution versus Morality
It is not only the NPCs that are faced with tough choices in life after societal collapse: the players should too. People are doing bad deeds all over the place. How do the players choose when to extract vengeance and when to forgive. Do the players hold to a moral code? Or are they base and selfish?

How do your players respond to someone who is stealing from the community stockpile of food? What justice do they dispatch upon a survivor who kills another in anger? What about a survivor who gives away vital information to a villain? Or a fool who brings a horde of zombies to their doorstep and upends months of hard work?

These questions of morality are key to both superhero stories and zombie stories. Look for opportunities for your NPCs to act selfishly, and worthy punishment, and watch as your players decide how to respond.

# Running Zombie-Supers Pulp Horror


### Running a Supers game
There are a few unique things about running an explicit Super Hero game. First off, Everyone wants to feel powerful and do cool stuff. Now, that isn't necessarily too different than any other game -- who wants their character to be boring? But Super Hero games promise that the characters are going to be protagonists. They are going to be mixing it up and making things happen. As a game master, keep this in mind and work to find moments for each character to shine.

In a Supers Game, we also need to be aware that we're not playing by "earth rules". Even in a street-level supers game, we're playing by comic-book rules. You'll want to be careful how far you stretch this, because there is a natural tension between the heroism of comic book rules and the grittiness of the zombie apocalypse -- but it essential to lean into some degree of comic book eccentricity and camp to realize the full super hero feel.

> **NB: Survivability and Power.** In Super Dead, the player characters are super in terms of their abilities, but rifle rounds can change that in a hurry, and zombies are **deadly**. Your players should not expect to have survivability on par with a "hit points"-style fantasy game.

Additionally, your villains shouldn't go away that easily. Did your heroes soundly defeat the villain by pushing them into a pit of acid? Did they fling them out of a building? Flatten them with car? No matter. Villains come back. Your players will want their villains to come back. A recurring rogue's gallery of foes that they can build relationships with is part of the intrigue. 

With that said, not all villains must be evil all the time. Feel free to team your villains up against the heroes. Or have a villain invite the heroes to team up against another, even stronger villain. 

And the anti-hero type fits in perfectly with the zombie apocalypse setting. These not-quite good, not-quite evil enigmas are an excellent foil and frustration to players who have heroic feats and deeds in mind.

### Running a Zombie game
Zombie games are horror games. That means they are about dread, fear, and anticipation. Super Dead has a few mechanics to create these situations, namely: the stress mechanic and the noise/zombie attraction mechanic. You must use these mechanics.

Put your players in situations where they must do things they don't want to: create noise, or super-charge their powers. And then let the game build the tension as stress and the number of incoming zombies grow.

Another essential way to test your players in a zombie game is to put them in moral quandaries. Give them lose-lose situations where survivors must die, or killing the big bad guy would result in being devoured by a zombie horde. These choices are fundamental to what makes zombie stories interesting: who are we when society has collapsed and it is only our own moral code telling us what to do? Give your players the opportunity to find out how their characters will answer the call.

In that same vein, zombie stories are about social dynamics. How do you treat the people around you when there is no one to keep you honest but yourself? Create factions with diametrically opposed personalities and see how the players respond. And remember, in many of the best zombie stories: humans were the real monsters all along


### Putting it all together
Ultimately, both Super Hero stories and Zombie stories are about people. So make the relationships between the players and the NPCs matter. Make the faction leader personalities large and obvious. Don't be afraid to make them larger than life caricatures -- that fits in nicely with super hero themes and creates obvious hooks for the players.

When making designing adventures and making rulings, be flexible with what is possible, but stringent with what is necessary. The players can do a lot of things, especially when using their powers and taking on stress. But they also need a lot of things: food, water, shelter, social interaction, safety, and relaxation to name a few. Make them feel the tension of a Super Hero, who still needs to eat just like everyone else.

## Starting a Session

The opening moments of a gaming session are your time to set the stage for the hours to come. Your session kickoff should have the following

- Recap
- Situation Summary
- Hooks / Next Steps
- Stakes

**Recap.** Remind your players what they did last time, focusing on things that are relevant to what you have planned for the upcoming session. If this is the first session, tell them how they arrived here.

**Situation Summary.** Summarize for the players the situation they are in. Tell them where they are and what is going on around them.

**Hooks/Next Steps.** Let the players know what they were planning on doing, what they were in the process of accomplishing, or what hooks they have uncovered. The players may have multiple hooks -- remind them of all of them.

**Stakes.** Optionally: introduce an additional complication that puts a time pressure on the players. The end of the world is difficult and stresses the player characters' basic needs. Tell one or more players they have a need they must meet -- and quickly -- or else they will suffer some penalty (usually several points of stress.) 

| 1d10 | Stakes |
| :-: | :- | 
| 1 | Your rations have waned and you're all starving. If you don't eat a large meal within the first hour of the session will take 2 stress every 30m until they do.| 
| 2 | You can feel the stress from the apocalypse building. If you don't find a way to blow off steam in the first hour of the session, take 4 stress.| 
| 3 | What started as a cut has now become a gnarly infection. You need medical supplies pronto. If you don't find medical supplies in the first hour of the session, take 1 stress. Until you receive medical attention, take 1 stress anytime you are hurt or wounded. | 
| 4 | You feel like all you ever do is talk to yourself these days. You need to find someone new to talk to in the first hour of the session or you will take 2 stress. All personality rolls are hard until this situation is resolved.| 
| 5 | Shelter | 
| 6 | Your ammo has dried up. You need to find more ammo quickly | 
| 7 | Loneliness | 
| 8 | Physical Contact | 
| 9 | Warmth | 
| 10 | Roll twice |

<!-- ## Building Adventures 

- Assume 1-3 scenes per hour, depending on the size of your group
- For a four hour session, you play about 12 scenes
- You should plan 75-80% of the scenes you need
- So for a four hour game, you might plan between 3 and 8 scenes.

---
- Mix scenes between combat, puzzles and problem solving, and social encounters
- Combat encounters should be further divided between fighting humans, mutants, and zombies
---
- Adventures can take place at detailed locations
- Travel between those locations is a type of **exploration**
- To chain locations together, aim to place 2 to 4 clues in locations you know the players will visit -->
