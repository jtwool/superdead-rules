# Running Zombie-Supers Pulp Horror

### Running a Supers game
- Players want to do cool stuff
- Players want to feel powerful
- "Comic book" rules are not real-life rules
- Villains don't go away that easily
- Anti-heroes and frenemies are your friends

### Running a Horror game
- Humans were the real monsters all along
- Social dynamics
- Dread, fear, stress
- Putting your morality to the test

### Putting it all together
- Play up humanities worst traits
- Play up humanities best traits
- Be flexible with "possible" (powers)
- Be stringent with what is "necessary" (food, water, loneliness)


## Running a Session
- Start the session with "stakes"
- The end of the world is hard, give the players 1 or 2 challenges to accomplish, in addition to exploration goals or site-based adventures
- These are not goals, but needs
- For example: the players might need food, water, medical supplies, or human contact
- Each challenge comes with a drawback
- You may have the challenges offer a benefit, or a cost -- but they do not need to

## Building Adventures 

- Assume 1-3 scenes per hour, depending on the size of your group
- For a four hour session, you play about 12 scenes
- You should plan 75-80% of the scenes you need
- So for a four hour game, you might plan between 3 and 8 scenes.

---
- Mix scenes between combat, puzzles and problem solving, and social encounters
- Combat encounters should be further divided between fighting humans, mutants, and zombies
---
- Adventures can take place at detailed locations
- Travel between those locations is a type of **exploration**
- To chain locations together, aim to place 2 to 4 clues in locations you know the players will visit
