<h2 id="civil-organizations"><a class="header" href="#civil-organizations">Civil Organizations</a></h2>
<p>Civil organizations reflect both the best and worst aspects of society. On one hand, they represent self-less public servants who give their lives and careers for the betterment of their neighbors and fellow citizens. On the other, they are home to the most corrupt grifters who line their pockets on the backs of the misfortunate, and the self-righteous zealots who believe they alone can know the good path for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="government"><a class="header" href="#government">Government</a></h3>
<p>Where an arm of government has made it to the end of days, it is no doubt due to the charisma of a cunning politician. Savvy and charming, a good politician can encourage their supporters just as well in the end of days as in the before times. Arguably, the skill is even more powerful now: keeping their hands clean while others risk their lives on their behalf.</p>
<p>Followers who are attracted to government organizations are optimists, who believe that their is a return to normal possible. And they look down on those who would turn to crime to stay alive.</p>
<h3 id="firefighters"><a class="header" href="#firefighters">Firefighters</a></h3>
<p>Firefighters——both career and volunteer——are fearless and physically impressive. Used to braving danger for their fellow man at a moments notice, the apocalypse is in some way, not so new. The threat, however, is much deadlier than what they are used to.</p>
<p>Firefighters thrive on comradery, self-sacrifice, duty, and action. Where organizations of firefighters have survived into the end times, they always seek to rescue other survivors and organize for safety. With a strong preference for action, firefighters stake out into the world to save lives——often tearing up buildings in the process.</p>
<h3 id="police"><a class="header" href="#police">Police</a></h3>
<p>At their best, police organizations are hierarchical, with a strict chain of command, and operate according to the code of law. Because they are well ordered and disciplined, many police organizations did survive into the end of days. There, they largely operate in the same fashion they always have: enforcing rules and protecting the populace, from both zombie, human, and mutant threats.</p>
<p>At their worst, police organizations are rigid, inflexible, and intentionally ignore the suffering of the people they purport to protect——to say nothing of nakedly corrupt. In the end of times, these flaws can be exaggerated. A jaded police organization can grow to see everyone as a lawbreaker, a threat, or simply someone that can be taken advantage of without recourse.</p>

</div>
<p>Because of their role in licensing  mutants and protecting the civilian population from mutants during the before times, some police officers have strongly held, negative prejudices towards mutants. Some police organizations even make it their primary goal to eliminate mutants, as they work to restore peace.</p>
<h2 id="civilian-organizations"><a class="header" href="#civilian-organizations">Civilian Organizations</a></h2>
<p>Civilian organizations are made up of and run by every day Jacks and Jills of the world. When these organizations survive, it is typically because of luck or an outstanding leader, more than any specific preparedness for the end of the world. Unlike many of the other organizations, civilian organizations are not particularly well prepared for the end of the world. Without help, they are likely to become prey for criminal organizations, or find themselves absorbed into police or military organizations that are better armed and able to protect the survivors that join them.</p>
<h3 id="corporations"><a class="header" href="#corporations">Corporations</a></h3>
<p>Corporations are driven by one thing: money. And the mega-corporations that were able to survive the apocalypse carry forward with that same motivation. These organizations take from their surrounding areas: pillaging, stockpiling, accumulating, and developing critical resources. Often to give it back to survivors unassociated with the corporation at a significant markup.</p>
<p>People who can help corporations accumulate wealth will find themselves in the corporations good graces—for so long as they are useful. But those who other motives, like putting an end to the zombie apocalypse, will find them subject to a corporations ire.</p>
<h3 id="religious-organizations"><a class="header" href="#religious-organizations">Religious Organizations</a></h3>
<p>Religious organizations exist to cultivate community and nurture the faith of their followers——and never have community and faith been more essential than in the end of times. While their is nothing that makes these organizations particularly well suited for surviving a zombie apocalypse, religious organizations tend to be close knit and optimistic, as much as one can be at the end of the world.</p>
<h3 id="labor-unions"><a class="header" href="#labor-unions">Labor Unions</a></h3>
<p>Labor unions existed in a state of constant struggle before the end of times——but now their foe is even more soulless than ever. Labor unions are run by——and privilege the interests of——workers and members among others. Labor organizations have no fear about operating two tiered systems, where everyone pulls together, but only true members reap the full rewards.</p>
<p>Labor union organizations can also be home to leftist idealists who view the end of times as a blessing in disguise: an opportunity to rebuild societies free of capitalist exploitation and corporate greed.</p>
<h3 id="research-labs"><a class="header" href="#research-labs">Research Labs</a></h3>
<p>Research Labs are collections of top scientists, dedicated to furthering public knowledge in a specific area: usually a deeply scientific area. These organizations prize intelligence and reputation above all else. When they do manage to exist in the end of days, they tend towards one of two tracks: one in which they pursue the same research goals they did before, not knowing any different; and one in which they rotate all their knowledge and brainpower for solving the current crisis, finding a cure, and rebuilding civilization.</p>
<h3 id="schools--universities"><a class="header" href="#schools--universities">Schools / Universities</a></h3>
<p>Like research labs, schools and universities prize intelligence. But unlike research labs, schools are fundamentally democratic institutions, drawing from all sections of the population. The professors and students may be intellectual powerhouses, but the football coaches, janitors, and administrators who make the schools runs are not necessarily so formidable. In this sense, schools serve as a post-apocalyptic mixing bowl, where members of the academic community come together and fight the undead.</p>
<p>Schools and universities have the distinct drawback of being high density areas, which attracted a lot of zombies initially. But once secured, sturdy and regal buildings with Labarynthian corridors are excellent defense against the living dead.</p>
<h3 id="secret-societies"><a class="header" href="#secret-societies">Secret Societies</a></h3>
<p>Remnants of days long past, when skilled tradesmen would meet in shadowy rooms to share secrets and shape the world's events in their favor, only a scarce few Secret Societies existed, and even fewer survived into the end of days. Those that did though, did so because they were prepared. They were a powerful force, lurking in the shadows all along, anticipating an apocalypse——if not several.</p>
<p>Now that its here, these Secret Societies have a plan to rebuild the world in their vision. Those who help them will reap their generosity; those who stand it their way, garner their wrath.</p>
<h2 id="criminal-organizations"><a class="header" href="#criminal-organizations">Criminal Organizations</a></h2>
<p>The ruthless and secretive nature of criminal organizations prepared them better, in many ways, for the end of the world.</p>
<p>Now, with governments weakened or destroyed altogether, these criminal organizations--which always had their own codes of conduct and systems of order--can self actualize as twisted, ruthless versions of society.</p>
<p>But being at the mercy of one may still be better than being dead.</p>
<h3 id="motorcycle-gangs"><a class="header" href="#motorcycle-gangs">Motorcycle Gangs</a></h3>
<p>Motorcycle gangs, outlaw motorcycle clubs, or 1%ers are bad mama jamas who break laws and ride bikes.</p>
<p>While the motorcycle has always been a symbol of recklessness, it is even more so in the end of times. Only the craziest survivors will get on the back of a loud machine certain to attract zombies.</p>
<p>That said, motorcycle gang members are as savage and savvy as they are reckless. Before the apocalypse these gangs trafficked in arms, drugs, and people. All of that has continued since the end of the world.</p>
<p>Where these gangs operate, they are a fearsome threat. Not only because of their propensity towards violence and chaos, but because of the zombies that are inevitable following them wherever their bikes roar.</p>
<h3 id="international-crime-syndicates"><a class="header" href="#international-crime-syndicates">International Crime Syndicates</a></h3>
<p>International crime syndicates were highly organized criminal enterprises that operated across national borders. Their operations were numerous and nefarious, including: drug trafficking, arms smuggling, human trafficking, and money laundering.</p>
<p>These organizations, such as the Mafia, Yakuza, Triads, and various cartels, are known for their hierarchical structures, extensive networks, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

<p>In normal times, they thrive by exploiting weaknesses in law enforcement and government oversight, leveraging corruption, violence, and secrecy to maintain their power and influence.</p>
<p>In a zombie apocalypse, branches of international crime syndicates were quickly able to leverage their existing resources and cunning ruthlessness to survive and sometimes even thrive amid the chaos.</p>
<p>With governments and law enforcement agencies weakened or collapsed, these organizations have no one to stop them from using their power to further their evil, but profitable operations.</p>
<h3 id="street-gangs"><a class="header" href="#street-gangs">Street Gangs</a></h3>
<p>Street Gangs emerged out of the need for the forgotten people to protect their own. And in the zombie apocalypse, they continued doing just that.</p>
<p>These gangs often have flatter and more dynamic structures than other gangs. And while they may use names that are shared with other gangs, their relationships and alliances are localized.</p>
<p>Street gangs first and foremost objective is to control heir territory and provide a quality life for their full members. And they will do anything to achieve that.</p>
<h3 id="prison-gangs"><a class="header" href="#prison-gangs">Prison Gangs</a></h3>
<p>Prison gangs are so named because they exist primarily inside of prisons, and exert pressure inside-out: from the prison onto the streets.</p>
<p>The prison gangs that exist in the post-apocalypse world are needing to adapt to the new reality of life outside the prison walls. But because of the prisons natural security, the few surviving prison gangs have large portions of their membership intact.</p>
<p>That makes these gangs formidable forces on the scene where ever they exist, with many members given a second chance at life by the zombie apocalypse that they never would have had otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="military-organizations"><a class="header" href="#military-organizations">Military Organizations</a></h2>
<p>Prepared to defend the homeland, military organizations are some of the best suited to surviving a zombie apocalypse. They are stocked with well trained and disciplined warriors, who have committed to putting the mission first and their own survival second.</p>
<p>Military organizations can be bastions of peace and security. But they can be ruthless if you find yourself on the wrong side of their objectives.</p>
<h3 id="army"><a class="header" href="#army">Army</a></h3>
<p>Responsible for invasion and defense by land, the Army is in many ways the best equipped to directly deal with a local zombie threat. They have the most troops, ammunition, and tools to manage direct conflict with infantry-on-infantry combat——like the living dead.</p>
<p>Organizations built on the remnants of an Army command will distinguish themselves from other military organizations with zombie impenetrable vehicles——tanks and armored personnel carriers——as well as earth-moving vehicles and tactics for reinforcing positions for defense. Whether the Army can use these techniques effectively is another story.</p>
<p>Army organizations are in excellent position to defend against the zombie apocalypse, but their tactics rely heavily on both <strong>fuel and ammo</strong>. Without these resources, the army's approaches are dramatically less effective. Securing these supplies will become an essential activity.</p>
<h3 id="navy"><a class="header" href="#navy">Navy</a></h3>
<p>Unlike the land-locked army, many naval commands have survived simply by virtue of being isolated on or underneath the water. The nuclear reactors on board submarines and aircraft carriers are capable of powering these vessels for decades without interruption. And these carrier groups are wholly equipped armies, with Marines that can be dispatched for land operations; pilots who can provide surveillance, air cover, and deliver crushing anti-zombie ordinance; and any number of daring sailors, familiar with spartan conditions.</p>
<p>As such, navy organizations take the security of their boats as a first order priority, sending small teams onto land to incrementally secure territory. The limiting factor to their effectiveness——like common survivors, in many ways——is the availability of food, water, and other supplies necessary for daily life.</p>
<h3 id="air-force"><a class="header" href="#air-force">Air Force</a></h3>
<p>Air Force bases no longer serve as potent sigils of destruction and dominance, but rather, as technological havens. Succumbing to an unsustainable dependence on modern resources—like jet fuel—the Air Force organizations that remain have pivoted into canny and brilliant logistic and technical operations. These outposts are now the sophisticated and well armed engineering operations in the world. Behind their chain fences and armed with simple personal weaponry, the Air Force's technicians build a new set of machines. Not to achieve air superiority, but to dispatch the zombie threat once and for all.</p>
<h3 id="intelligence-agency"><a class="header" href="#intelligence-agency">Intelligence Agency</a></h3>
<p>Intelligence Agencies are shadowy organizations adjacent to the military, used to operating in a clandestine fashion. They do not have the large armaments for direct conflict, but they have highly trained operatives and penchant for thinking outside the box.</p>
<p>Their true strengths lie in the ability to form relationships with diverse sets of power brokers, establish a strong situational awareness, and devise cunning plans to achieve their desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Any organization founded on the remnants of an intelligence agency is going to be hard to detect—likely operating under some form of cover—and with a dispersed network of moles and agents throughout the relevant location.</p>
